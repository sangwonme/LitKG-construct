    "title": "Design Card Sets: Systematic Literature Survey and Card Sorting Study",
    "abstract": "Design cards are a popular way for designers to encode and communicate design knowledge. Aiming to inform the designers of such design tools we set out to characterize the design space of design cards in a two-pronged approach involving a) a systematic literature survey on the use of design cards and b) card sorting interviews, which were carried out in order to characterize the first impressions of design cards from design students, for different formal qualities and content of design cards. Our results point towards a need to develop more abstract and evocative presentations, that are visually attractive while supporting a flexible application of cards. Future research could explore whether such preferences are consistent with how card sets are used during design processes in practice.",

    "abstract": "Location based mobile games have traditionally relied on implicit codes of conduct, legal ordinances, common social norms, or community emergent rules. However, these games are becoming increasingly popular and enforcing these implicit or explicit restrictions has become difficult. In this paper, we present a critical and systematic review of both commercial and non-commercial location based mobile games. We list selected characteristics of the games and highlight their connection to the affordances and restrictions on urban game arenas. We also demonstrate the feasibility of our characterization by applying it to two recent location based mobile games, Pokemon GO [53] and Street Art Gangs [4].",

    "abstract": "Activity in Human-Food Interaction (HFI) research is skyrocketing across a broad range of disciplinary interests and concerns. The dynamic and heterogeneous nature of this emerging field presents a challenge to scholars wishing to critically engage with prior work, identify gaps and ensure impact. It also challenges the formation of community. We present a Systematic Mapping Study of HFI research and an online data visualisation tool developed to respond to these issues. The tool allows researchers to engage in new ways with the HFI literature, propose modifications and additions to the review, and thereby actively engage in community-making. Our contribution is threefold: (1) we characterize the state of HFI, reporting trends, challenges and opportunities; (2) we provide a taxonomy and tool for diffractive reading of the literature; and (3) we offer our approach for adaptation by research fields facing similar challenges, positing value of the tool and approach beyond HFI.",

    "abstract": "This paper reviews how empirical research on User Experience (UX) is conducted. It integrates products, dimensions of experience, and methodologies across a systematically selected sample of 51 publications from 2005-2009, reporting a total of 66 empirical studies. Results show a shift in the products and use contexts that are studied, from work towards leisure, from controlled tasks towards open use situations, and from desktop computing towards consumer products and art. Context of use and anticipated use, often named key factors of UX, are rarely researched. Emotions, enjoyment and aesthetics are the most frequently assessed dimensions. The methodologies used are mostly qualitative, and known from traditional usability studies, though constructive methods with unclear validity are being developed and used. Many studies use self-developed questionnaires without providing items or statistical validations. We discuss underexplored research questions and potential improvements of UX research.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a systematic literature review on collaborative technologies for children with special needs in ACM Digital Library. The aim of the review is to (1) reveal the current state of the art, (2) identify the types of technologies and contexts of use, the demographics and special needs of the target group, and the methodological approaches and theoretical groundings, and (3) define a future research agenda. The results of the systematic literature review show that collaborative technologies for children with special needs are increasingly gaining attention, mostly involve tangible and/or embodied interaction, and are often developed for use in the classroom. The target group that is most represented are boys between 6 to 12 years with Autism Spectrum Disorder. The results further show a wide range of evaluation criteria for measuring collaboration, an interchanging use of theoretical concepts and a lack of definitions for the concept collaboration, and a need for more demographically diverse studies.",

    "title": "Who Are You Asking?: Qualitative Methods for Involving AAC Users as Primary Research Participants",
    "abstract": "When trying to understand people's perspectives, qualitative researchers in HCI often use methods which assume participants can easily communicate verbally. There are few dedicated resources in HCI which provide an overview of qualitative methods to effectively gather the perspectives of people who cannot easily communicate verbally; specifically, people who use Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC). As a result, AAC users might be excluded from studies using methods such as interviews or focus groups, even if they fit the researcher's target population. To address this problem, I review literature from both HCI and therapeutic AAC research fields to discuss methods used with AAC users. In addition, I present relevant case examples from my own qualitative research and propose a framework to guide HCI researchers on choosing appropriate methods when involving AAC users as central research participants. I also identify design opportunities for HCI researchers to innovate on the tools and methods used for qualitative research with AAC users. This paper provides an easily accessible overview of qualitative methods HCI researchers can use with AAC users as participants.",

    "title": "Non-Rigid HCI: A Review of Deformable Interfaces and Input",
    "abstract": "Deformable interfaces are emerging in HCI and prototypes show potential for non-rigid interactions. Previous reviews looked at deformation as a material property of shape-changing interfaces and concentrated on output. As such,deformable input was under-discussed. We distinguish deformable from shape-changing interfaces to concentrate on input. We survey 131 papers on deformable interfaces and review their key design elements (e.g., shape, material) based on how they support input. Our survey shows that deformable input was often used to augment or replace rigid input, particularly on elastic and flexible displays. However, when shapes and materials guide interactions, deformable input was used to explore new HCI paradigms, where gestures are potentially endless, and input become analogy to sculpting, metaphor to non-verbal communication, and expressive controls are enhanced. Our review provides designers and practitioners with a baseline for designing deformable interfaces and input methodically. We conclude by highlighting under-explored areas and identify research goals to tackle in future work with deformable interfaces.",

    "title": "Technology Developments in Touch-Based Accessible Graphics: A Systematic Review of Research 2010-2020",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a systematic literature review of 292 publications from 97 unique venues on touch-based graphics for people who are blind or have low vision, from 2010 to mid-2020. It is the first review of its kind on touch-based accessible graphics. It is timely because it allows us to assess the impact of new technologies such as commodity 3D printing and low-cost electronics on the production and presentation of accessible graphics. As expected our review shows an increase in publications from 2014 that we can attribute to these developments. It also reveals the need to: broaden application areas, especially to the workplace; broaden end-user participation throughout the full design process; and conduct more in situ evaluation. This work is linked to an online living resource to be shared with the wider community.",

    "abstract": "We describe the primary ways researchers can determine the size of a sample of research participants, present the benefits and drawbacks of each of those methods, and focus on improving one method that could be useful to the CHI community: local standards. To determine local standards for sample size within the CHI community, we conducted an analysis of all manuscripts published at CHI2014. We find that sample size for manuscripts published at CHI ranges from 1 -- 916,000 and the most common sample size is 12. We also find that sample size differs based on factors such as study setting and type of methodology employed. The outcome of this paper is an overview of the various ways sample size may be determined and an analysis of local standards for sample size within the CHI community. These contributions may be useful to researchers planning studies and reviewers evaluating the validity of results.",

    "abstract": "Researchers working in domains such as Research through Design and Feminist HCI have been questioning \"dissemination practices\" and their impact on our capacity to produce reflexive accounts of research in publications. This paper examines academic dissemination practices within HCI research communities from an institutional to individual level. We unpack the practice via a meta-review of recent literature published in CHI and other venues on 'What is HCI?'. We review the core text on this debate and other similar discussions on HCI methodologies and reflexive accounts of research in domains such as 'Research through Design' and 'Feminist HCI'. We highlight the importance of practicing reflexivity through dissemination and introduce 'Research Fictions' in the form of video essays and live performances, produced by the first author with her colleagues, based on their HCI submissions. Through experimenting with alternative dissemination formats, we argue that our exploratory processes engender a practice of reflexivity within a research lab.",

    "abstract": "We present an empirical analysis of HCI for development (HCI4D), a growing research area aimed at understanding and designing technologies for under-served, under-resourced, and under-represented populations around the world. We first present findings from our survey of 259 HCI4D publications from the past six years and summarize how this research has evolved, with an overview of the geographies it covers, technologies it targets, and its varied epistemological and methodological underpinnings. We then discuss qualitative findings from interviews we conducted with 11 experienced HCI4D researchers, reflecting on the ground covered so far Including computing and research trends, community-building efforts, and thoughts about 'development' - as well as challenges that lie ahead and suggestions for future growth and diversification. We conclude by summarizing the contributions our paper makes to HCI researchers inside the HCI4D community as well as those outside of it, with the goal of enriching discussions on how HCI can further benefit populations around the world.",

    "title": "Consistent but modest: a meta-analysis on unimodal and multimodal affect detection accuracies from 30 studies",
    "abstract": "The recent influx of multimodal affect classifiers raises the important question of whether these classifiers yield accuracy rates that exceed their unimodal counterparts. This question was addressed by performing a meta-analysis on 30 published studies that reported both multimodal and unimodal affect detection accuracies. The results indicated that multimodal accuracies were consistently better than unimodal accuracies and yielded an average 8.12% improvement over the best unimodal classifiers. However, performance improvements were three times lower when classifiers were trained on natural or seminatural data (4.39% improvement) compared to acted data (12.1% improvement). Importantly, performance of the best unimodal classifier explained an impressive 80.6% (cross-validated) of the variance in multimodal accuracy. The results also indicated that multimodal accuracies were substantially higher than accuracies of the second-best unimodal classifiers (an average improvement of 29.4%) irrespective of the naturalness of the training data. Theoretical and applied implications of the findings are discussed.",

    "title": "Effectiveness of Red-Light Running Countermeasures: A Systematic Review",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a systematic review of the literature on the effectiveness of engineering countermeasures at reducing unintentional Red-Light Running (RLR) violations and improving safety at traffic intersections. 26 relevant studies on countdown timers, pavement markings, signal operations, advance warning systems, and in-vehicle warning systems are discussed and their results are summarized. While all countermeasures demonstrated varying levels of effectiveness, in-vehicle warning systems that provided audio and/or visual feedback to drivers were found to be the most promising in lowering RLR rates, with studies showing RLR reduction by 84.3%, collision rate reduction by 37%, lower RLR probability and lower risks of crashes. Limitations of each countermeasure are discussed and research shortcomings are indicated. Further areas of potential advancements are highlighted and refinement of countermeasures are proposed in light of improving their effectiveness in reducing RLR violations and improving intersection safety.",

    "abstract": "Many research applications and popular commercial applications include features for sharing personally collected data with others in social awareness streams. Prior work has identified several barriers to use as well as discrepancies between designer goals and how these features are used in practice. We develop a framework for designing and evaluating these features based on an extensive review of prior literature. We demonstrate the value of this framework by analyzing physical activity sharing on Twitter, coding 4,771 tweets and their responses and gathering 444 reactions from 97 potential tweet recipients, learning that specific user-generated content leads to more responses and is better received by the post audience. We conclude by extending our findings to other sharing problems and discussing the value of our design framework.",

    "title": "The Role of Learning Theory in Child-Computer Interaction - A Semi-Systematic Literature Review",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we explore the role of learning theory in the Child-computer interaction (CCI) community’s leading venues: the Interaction Design and Children (IDC) conference and the International Journal of Child-Computer Interaction (IJCCI). Searching all publications in the IDC conference proceedings and IJCCI, 63 papers that use the word stem ‘learn*’ in title, abstract and keywords were included in the corpus. Based on an analysis of these papers, our semi-systematic literature review demonstrates that assessment of learning regarding transfer of learning and controlled groups is rare, that the main role for learning theory is application, and that four main theoretical positions on learning can be recognized: constructivism, constructionism, cognitive theories, and socio-cognitive theory. The paper further presents an overview of how and which learning theories are used, and outlines paths for future CCI research based on the results.",

    "abstract": "Human personality has been identified as a predictor of robot acceptance in the human–robot interaction (HRI) literature. Despite this, the HRI literature has provided mixed support for this assertion. To better understand the relationship between human personality and robot acceptance, this paper conducts a meta-analysis of 26 studies. Results found a positive relationship between human personality and robot acceptance. However, this relationship varied greatly by the specific personality trait along with the study sample’s age, gender diversity, task, and global region. This meta-analysis also identified gaps in the literature. Namely, additional studies are needed that investigate both the big five personality traits and other personality traits, examine a more diverse age range, and utilize samples from previously unexamined regions of the globe.",

    "title": "All You Need is Love: Current Strategies of Mediating Intimate Relationships through Technology",
    "abstract": "A wealth of evidence suggests that love, closeness, and intimacy---in short relatedness---are important for people’s psychological well-being. Nowadays, however, couples are often forced to live apart. Accordingly, there has been a growing and flourishing interest in designing technologies that mediate (and create) a feeling of relatedness when being separated, beyond the explicit verbal communication and simple emoticons available technologies offer. This article provides a review of 143 published artifacts (i.e., design concepts, technologies). Based on this, we present six strategies used by designers/researchers to create a relatedness experience: Awareness, expressivity, physicalness, gift giving, joint action, and memories. We understand those strategies as starting points for the experience-oriented design of technology.",

    "abstract": "How is technology being designed to improve children's well-being? We address this question in connection to childhood overweight issues. On a global level, overweight and obesity among children and youth is recognized to be an alarmingly growing health challenge. We have conducted a literature review to explore how studies from the Interaction design and children (IDC) community frame health challenges related to overweight amongst children and youth. Based on the available IDC research focusing on aspects connected to overweight problems, we identify patterns in type of initiative, ages of children, context of use, kind of solution or technology, focus of the research activities and theoretical frameworks. We discuss the importance of increased research and development efforts in this area within the IDC community and call for a broader approach in terms of initiatives, research focus and application of philosophical paradigms and related theory to address a holistic understanding of children's well-being.",

    "abstract": "Many automated vehicles are already on our roads, and we can expect that many more will follow soon. Yet, the legal frameworks that govern the deployment and operation of these vehicles are still under development. This paper explores legal issues related to the human-machine interaction for automated vehicles. The paper reviews the current legal landscape, with a focus on the United States, and presents some of the issues that will be of interest to researchers, developers, and regulators as the new legal frameworks take shape.",

    "title": "Affective Grounding in Human-Robot Interaction",
    "abstract": "Participating in interaction requires not only coordination on content and process, as previously proposed, but also on affect. The term affective grounding is introduced to refer to the coordination of affect in interaction with the purpose of building shared understanding about what behavior can be exhibited, and how behavior is interpreted emotionally and responded to. Affective Ground is achieved when interactants have reached shared understanding about how behavior should be interpreted emotionally. The paper contributes a review and critique of current perspectives on emotion in HRI. Further it outlines how research on emotion in HRI can benefit from taking an affective grounding perspective and outlines implications for the design of robots capable of participating in the coordination on affect in interaction.",

    "title": "Characterizing the Design Space of Rendered Robot Faces",
    "abstract": "Faces are critical in establishing the agency of social robots; however, building expressive mechanical faces is costly and difficult. Instead, many robots built in recent years have faces that are rendered onto a screen. This gives great flexibility in what a robot’s face can be and opens up a new design space with which to establish a robot’s character and perceived properties. Despite the prevalence of robots with rendered faces, there are no systematic explorations of this design space. Our work aims to fill that gap. We conducted a survey and identified 157 robots with rendered faces and coded them in terms of 76 properties. We present statistics, common patterns, and observations about this data set of faces. Next, we conducted two surveys to understand people’s perceptions of rendered robot faces and identify the impact of different face features. Survey results indicate preferences for varying levels of realism and detail in robot faces based on context, and indicate how the presence or absence of specific features affects perception of the face and the types of jobs the face would be appropriate for.",

    "title": "Another decade of IDC research: examining and reflecting on values and ethics",
    "abstract": "Examining the values inherent in papers published at IDC provides a lens to our research community and informs the path of future research needs and opportunities. We conducted a content analysis of the values expressed in all full IDC papers between 2011 and 2019 and a survey with the first authors of 20% of these papers. We examine the types of IDC research contributions, the qualities and behaviors the research seeks to support in children, the role of the child and other stakeholders in the design process, the theories that inform IDC research, and the criteria that guide the technical design choices. We discuss the research contributions and the core value trends over the past two decades of IDC full published papers. We also present the ethical considerations central to the surveyed authors' work. Based on our analysis, we discuss implications and opportunities for future contributions, such as explicit attention to inclusivity in research, encouraging multidisciplinary collaborations, and expanding the qualities our community aims to support in children. These qualities include: focusing on children's sense of autonomy, agency, and empowerment; and children's participation in research as active creators of technology.",

    "title": "Awareness Supporting Technologies used in Collaborative Systems: A Systematic Literature Review",
    "abstract": "Since the establishment of Computer Supported Collaborative Work as a research area, computer advances have change the paradigm of how technology is applied to improve the performance in collaborative scenarios. Notifications are an important part of this improvement. Technological systems have been applied in order to provide collaborators with the sufficient awareness to keep a task going. In this paper we present the protocol and results of a Systematic Literature Review that delves in the application of new technologies to provide awareness in collaborative systems. Moreover, we classify the collaborative systems found in literature using two traditional taxonomies for CSCW in order to understand which notification mechanisms are used to support which systems. Our review covers the last 10 years and classifies system prototypes based on the context in which they are applied, the notification and information gathering mechanism used, and the assessment performed. With over 400 papers reviewed, 83 that met the review requirements were included. The review results show that traditional interfaces and mobile devices are still the most common notification mechanisms. However, ubiquitous devices and non-traditional interfaces have also been used.",

    "abstract": "Accessibility research has grown substantially in the past few decades, yet there has been no literature review of the field. To understand current and historical trends, we created and analyzed a dataset of accessibility papers appearing at CHI and ASSETS since ASSETS’ founding in 1994. We qualitatively coded areas of focus and methodological decisions for the past 10 years (2010-2019, N=506 papers), and analyzed paper counts and keywords over the full 26 years (N=836 papers). Our findings highlight areas that have received disproportionate attention and those that are underserved—for example, over 43% of papers in the past 10 years are on accessibility for blind and low vision people. We also capture common study characteristics, such as the roles of disabled and nondisabled participants as well as sample sizes (e.g., a median of 13 for participant groups with disabilities and older adults). We close by critically reflecting on gaps in the literature and offering guidance for future work in the field.",

    "title": "What Makes a Dark Pattern... Dark?: Design Attributes, Normative Considerations, and Measurement Methods",
    "abstract": "There is a rapidly growing literature on dark patterns, user interface designs—typically related to shopping or privacy—that researchers deem problematic. Recent work has been predominantly descriptive, documenting and categorizing objectionable user interfaces. These contributions have been invaluable in highlighting specific designs for researchers and policymakers. But the current literature lacks a conceptual foundation: What makes a user interface a dark pattern? Why are certain designs problematic for users or society? We review recent work on dark patterns and demonstrate that the literature does not reflect a singular concern or consistent definition, but rather, a set of thematically related considerations. Drawing from scholarship in psychology, economics, ethics, philosophy, and law, we articulate a set of normative perspectives for analyzing dark patterns and their effects on individuals and society. We then show how future research on dark patterns can go beyond subjective criticism of user interface designs and apply empirical methods grounded in normative perspectives.",

    "title": "A systematic review of quantitative studies on the enjoyment of digital entertainment games",
    "abstract": "Enjoyment has been identified as a central component of the player experience (PX), but various, overlapping concepts within PX make it difficult to develop valid measures and a common understanding of game enjoyment. We conducted a systematic review of 87 quantitative studies, analyzing different operationalizations and measures of game enjoyment, its determinants, and how these were related to other components of PX, such as flow, presence and immersion. Results suggest that game enjoyment describes the positive cognitive and affective appraisal of the game experience, and may in part be associated with the support of player needs and values. Further, we outline that enjoyment is distinct from flow in that it may occur independently of challenge and cognitive involvement, and argue that enjoyment may be understood as the valence of the player experience. We conclude with a discussion of methodological challenges and point out opportunities for future research on game enjoyment.",

    "abstract": "To increase the safety in use of automated vehicles, Human Factors research has focused primarily on driver performance during take-over situations. However, surveys on public opinion on automated vehicles still report a lack of acceptance of the technology. In this review, we give an overview on how taking the changed role of the driver into account when designing Human-Machine Interfaces (HMI) of automated vehicles could increase the usefulness of the technology, which might in turn result in increased public acceptance. We propose that balancing the driver's need of being informed about the automated vehicle's status, actions and intentions with the desire to engage in non-driving related tasks (NDRTs) is likely to play an important role in this process.",

    "abstract": "The use of autonomous behaviour in Tangible User Interfaces can potentially create a compelling and new kind of interaction between humans and computers. We motivate this argument by reviewing related research, which indicates that people are engaged by apparently autonomous behaviours in tangible objects and apply rules of social behaviour towards these smart objects. Our intention is to leverage this effect in support of human-computer interaction. Rather than aiming to improve user performance, we argue that such interfaces can offer a richer and more enjoyable autonomous interface interaction. Herein we present a framework highlighting key concepts and characteristics which are important while designing and implementing Tangible Autonomous Interfaces.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores the relationships between fashion and Sustainable HCI, with an eye towards identifying positive design opportunities that create sustainable good. First, we report on a review of fashion-related literatures outside of HCI, mostly in sociocultural studies, business and marketing research. Within HCI, we use Blevis' five sustainable interaction design principles as a frame to present new directions that arise from thinking about fashion in relation to sustainability. In order to construct a clear basis for fashion thinking within the domain of HCI, we postulate six fashion concepts that owe to literatures outside of HCI. For each fashion concept, we derive a fashion thinking issue, provide design examples, and propose actionable design principles, to illustrate the instrumental value that each fashion concept offers to sustainable HCI. We conclude simply by identifying future research directions to which we and others may contribute.",

    "title": "Standardizing Reporting of Participant Compensation in HCI: A Systematic Literature Review and Recommendations for the Field",
    "abstract": "The user study is a fundamental method used in HCI. In designing user studies, we often use compensation strategies to incentivize recruitment. However, compensation can also lead to ethical issues, such as coercion. The CHI community has yet to establish best practices for participant compensation. Through a systematic review of manuscripts at CHI and other associated publication venues, we found high levels of variation in the compensation strategies used within the community and how we report on this aspect of the study methods. A qualitative analysis of justifications offered for compensation sheds light into how some researchers are currently contextualizing this practice. This paper provides a description of current compensation strategies and information that can inform the design of compensation strategies in future studies. The findings may be helpful to generate productive discourse in the HCI community towards the development of best practices for participant compensation in user studies.",

    "title": "A Bermuda Triangle?: A Review of Method Application and Triangulation in User Experience Evaluation",
    "abstract": "User experience (UX) evaluation is a growing field with diverse approaches. To understand the development since previous meta-review efforts, we conducted a state-of-the-art review of UX evaluation techniques with special attention to the triangulation between methods. We systematically selected and analyzed 100 papers from recent years and while we found an increase of relevant UX studies, we also saw a remaining overlap with pure usability evaluations. Positive trends include an increasing percentage of field rather than lab studies and a tendency to combine several methods in UX studies. Triangulation was applied in more than two thirds of the studies, and the most common method combination was questionnaires and interviews. Based on our analysis, we derive common patterns for triangulation in UX evaluation efforts. A critical discussion about existing approaches should help to obtain stronger results, especially when evaluating new technologies.",

    "abstract": "Motivated by a recent surge of research related to energy and sustainability, this paper presents a review of energy-related work within HCI as well as from literature outside of HCI. Our review of energy-related HCI research identifies a central cluster of work focused on electricity consumption feedback (ECF). Our review of literature outside of HCI highlights a number of emerging energy systems trends of strong relevance to HCI and interaction design, including smart grid, demand response, and distributed generation technologies. We conclude by outlining a range of opportunities for HCI to engage with the experiential, behavioral, social, and cultural aspects of these emerging systems, including highlighting new areas for ECF research that move beyond our field's current focus on energy feedback displays to increase awareness and motivate individual conservation behavior.",

    "abstract": "We present a comprehensive and structured review of 132 peer-reviewed publications between the years of 2008 and 2015 to inform Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) researchers and interaction designers about the current and multi-disciplinary knowledge on the topic of adolescent online safety and risks. Overall, we found that the existing literature has deeply studied the phenomena around adolescent online safety through an in-depth examination of the prevalence, perceptions, behaviors, characteristics, and outcomes associated with various online risk experiences. However, very few studies have moved beyond formative evaluations that inform design to novel design interventions or summative evaluations of new designs that serve to effectively change the status quo.",

    "abstract": "Electronic textiles, or eTextiles, and connected research and practice communities grew within and across diverse disciplines over the past 20 years. Initially evolving from academic investigations, eTextiles now play a growing role in both industry and education alike. While we are increasingly confronted with resulting eTextile artefacts, we lack a thorough understanding of the underlying making practices, and in particular what role toolkits play in framing, promoting and supporting creation practices. It is timely then to undertake a review of currently available eTextile tools and kits, discussing the technical, cultural and social expectations inscribed in these settings and how their design and technology impacts the emerging field of eTextiles. Here we compile the first overview of both academic research and popular available toolkits, as a basis for an analysis of potential strategies for future directions: how to diversify and professionalise the field and its community of practice.",

    "title": "HCI meets Material Science: A Literature Review of Morphing Materials for the Design of Shape-Changing Interfaces",
    "abstract": "With the proliferation of flexible displays and the advances in smart materials, it is now possible to create interactive devices that are not only flexible but can reconfigure into any shape on demand. Several Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and robotics researchers have started designing, prototyping and evaluating shape-changing devices, realising, however, that this vision still requires many engineering challenges to be addressed. On the material science front, we need breakthroughs in stable and accessible materials to create novel, proof-of-concept devices. On the interactive devices side, we require a deeper appreciation for the material properties and an understanding of how exploiting material properties can provide affordances that unleash the human interactive potential. While these challenges are interesting for the respective research fields, we believe that the true power of shape-changing devices can be magnified by bringing together these communities. In this paper we therefore present a review of advances made in shape-changing materials and discuss their applications within an HCI context.",

    "title": "Wizard of Awwws: Exploring Psychological Impact on the Researchers in Social HRI Experiments",
    "abstract": "In social Human-Robot Interaction (sHRI) people have studied social interactions with awkward, confrontational, or unsettling robots. In order to create these situations, researchers often secretly control the robot (the \"Wizard of Oz\", WoZ, technique), use confederates (researchers pretending to be participants), or the researchers themselves create the desired social condition. While these studies may be antagonistic, they are designed to be ethical; when conducting a study, IRB (Institutional Review Board) processes are in place to assess the study design for potential risk to participants, and to ultimately protect the public. However, these processes do not generally involve assessment of impact on the researchers conducting the study. In our own work, we have noted how researcher \"wizards\" in social HRI experiments, particularly those which place participants in awkward or confrontational situations, can themselves be negatively impacted from the experience when their experiment protocol has them antagonize, deceive, or argue with participants. In this paper, we explore how experimental design can impact the wellbeing of the researchers, particularly for wizards in social HRI experiments. By building a psychological grounding for the impact on people who do socially stressful actions, we evaluate the potential for researcher social stress in recent sHRI studies. Our summary and discussion of this survey results in recommendations for future HRI research to reduce the burden on wizards in their own experiments.",

    "title": "Evaluating Creativity Support Tools in HCI Research",
    "abstract": "The design and development of Creativity Support Tools (CSTs) is of growing interest in research at the intersection of creativity and Human-Computer Interaction, and has been identified as a 'grand challenge for HCI'. While creativity research and HCI each have had long-standing discussions about---and rich toolboxes of---evaluation methodologies, the nascent field of CST evaluation has so far received little attention. We contribute a survey of 113 research papers that present and evaluate CSTs, and we offer recommendations for future CST evaluation. We center our discussion around six major points that researchers might consider: 1) Clearly define the goal of the CST; 2) link to theory to further understanding of usage of CSTs; 3) recruit domain experts, if applicable and feasible; 4) consider longitudinal, in-situ studies; 5) distinguish and decide whether to evaluate usability or creativity; and 6) as a community, help develop a toolbox for CST evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative persona creation (QPC) has tremendous potential, as HCI researchers and practitioners can leverage user data from online analytics and digital media platforms to better understand their users and customers. However, there is a lack of a systematic overview of the QPC methods and progress made, with no standard methodology or known best practices. To address this gap, we review 49 QPC research articles from 2005 to 2019. Results indicate three stages of QPC research: Emergence, Diversification, and Sophistication. Sharing resources, such as datasets, code, and algorithms, is crucial to achieving the next stage (Maturity). For practitioners, we provide guiding questions for assessing QPC readiness in organizations.",

    "title": "HCI and Affective Health: Taking stock of a decade of studies and charting future research directions",
    "abstract": "In the last decade, the number of articles on HCI and health has increased dramatically. We extracted 139 papers on depression, anxiety and bipolar health issues from 10 years of SIGCHI conference proceedings. 72 of these were published in the last two years. A systematic analysis of this growing body of literature revealed that most innovation happens in automated diagnosis, and self-tracking, although there are innovative ideas in tangible interfaces. We noted an overemphasis on data production without consideration of how it leads to fruitful interventions. Moreover, we see a need to promote ethical practices for involvement of people living with affective disorders. Finally, although only 16 studies evaluate technologies in a clinical context, several forms of support and intervention illustrate how rich insights are gained from evaluations with real patients. Our findings highlight potential for growth in the design space of affective health technologies.",

    "title": "A Human-Centered Review of Algorithms used within the U.S. Child Welfare System",
    "abstract": "The U.S. Child Welfare System (CWS) is charged with improving outcomes for foster youth; yet, they are overburdened and underfunded. To overcome this limitation, several states have turned towards algorithmic decision-making systems to reduce costs and determine better processes for improving CWS outcomes. Using a human-centered algorithmic design approach, we synthesize 50 peer-reviewed publications on computational systems used in CWS to assess how they were being developed, common characteristics of predictors used, as well as the target outcomes. We found that most of the literature has focused on risk assessment models but does not consider theoretical approaches (e.g., child-foster parent matching) nor the perspectives of caseworkers (e.g., case notes). Therefore, future algorithms should strive to be context-aware and theoretically robust by incorporating salient factors identified by past research. We provide the HCI community with research avenues for developing human-centered algorithms that redirect attention towards more equitable outcomes for CWS.",

    "abstract": "As robots become more prevalent, the importance of the field of human-robot interaction (HRI) grows accordingly. As such, we should endeavor to employ the best statistical practices. Likert scales are commonly used metrics in HRI to measure perceptions and attitudes. Due to misinformation or honest mistakes, most HRI researchers do not adopt best practices when analyzing Likert data. We conduct a review of psychometric literature to determine the current standard for Likert scale design and analysis. Next, we conduct a survey of four years of the International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (2016 through 2019) and report on incorrect statistical practices and design of Likert scales. During these years, only 3 of the 110 papers applied proper statistical testing to correctly-designed Likert scales. Our analysis suggests there are areas for meaningful improvement in the design and testing of Likert scales. Lastly, we provide recommendations to improve the accuracy of conclusions drawn from Likert data.",

    "abstract": "What is Mixed Reality (MR)? To revisit this question given the many recent developments, we conducted interviews with ten AR/VR experts from academia and industry, as well as a literature survey of 68 papers. We find that, while there are prominent examples, there is no universally agreed on, one-size-fits-all definition of MR. Rather, we identified six partially competing notions from the literature and experts' responses. We then started to isolate the different aspects of reality relevant for MR experiences, going beyond the primarily visual notions and extending to audio, motion, haptics, taste, and smell. We distill our findings into a conceptual framework with seven dimensions to characterize MR applications in terms of the number of environments, number of users, level of immersion, level of virtuality, degree of interaction, input, and output. Our goal with this paper is to support classification and discussion of MR applications' design and provide a better means to researchers to contextualize their work within the increasingly fragmented MR landscape.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a systematic review of HCI literature focusing on children with ADHD, the prevailing mental health diagnosis in children. Its aim is to (i) chart the state-of-the-art in this domain (e.g. methods used), (ii) identify the ways the HCI community has addressed the needs of children with ADHD (e.g. technologies deployed), and (iii) describe the involvement of the various stakeholders playing a role in their everyday experiences (i.e. their care ecosystem). Our findings show limited engagement of the care ecosystem in the design, development and user studies of current technologies, and shortcomings in designing for multiple ecosystem stakeholders, despite their crucial role. We also find that most HCI contributions are systems aiming to address ADHD-related symptoms. Based on our findings, we provide suggestions for further research and design considerations for future systems that empower and promote the well-being of children with ADHD, while considering their care ecosystem.",

    "title": "The Emergence of EyePlay: A Survey of Eye Interaction in Games",
    "abstract": "As eye trackers become cheaper, smaller, more robust, and more available, they finally leave research labs and enter the home environment. In this context, gaming arises as a promising application domain for eye interaction. The goal of this survey is to categorise the different ways in which the eyes can be incorporated into games and play in general as a resource for future design. We reviewed the literature on the topic, as well as other game prototypes that employ the eyes. We compiled a list of eye-enabled game mechanics and derived a taxonomy that classifies them according to the eye movements they involve, the input type they provide, and the game mechanics that they implement. Based on our findings we articulate the value of gaming for future HCI gaze research and outline a research program around eye interaction in gaming.",

    "title": "What is \"intelligent\" in intelligent user interfaces?: a meta-analysis of 25 years of IUI",
    "abstract": "This reflection paper takes the 25th IUI conference milestone as an opportunity to analyse in detail the understanding of intelligence in the community: Despite the focus on intelligent UIs, it has remained elusive what exactly renders an interactive system or user interface \"intelligent\", also in the fields of HCI and AI at large. We follow a bottom-up approach to analyse the emergent meaning of intelligence in the IUI community: In particular, we apply text analysis to extract all occurrences of \"intelligent\" in all IUI proceedings. We manually review these with regard to three main questions: 1) What is deemed intelligent? 2) How (else) is it characterised? and 3) What capabilities are attributed to an intelligent entity? We discuss the community's emerging implicit perspective on characteristics of intelligence in intelligent user interfaces and conclude with ideas for stating one's own understanding of intelligence more explicitly.",

    "abstract": "Statistical Significance Testing -- or Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) -- is common to quantitative CHI PLAY research. Drawing from recent work in HCI and psychology promoting transparent statistics and the reduction of questionable research practices, we systematically review the reporting quality of 119 CHI PLAY papers using NHST (data and analysis plan at OSF.io). We find that over half of these papers employ NHST without specific statistical hypotheses or research questions, which may risk the proliferation of false positive findings. Moreover, we observe inconsistencies in the reporting of sample sizes and statistical tests. These issues reflect fundamental incompatibilities between NHST and the frequently exploratory work common to CHI PLAY. We discuss the complementary roles of exploratory and confirmatory research, and provide a template for more transparent research and reporting practices.",

    "abstract": "Advances in vehicle automation and the resulting change of the interior of cars lead to new challenges for user interface concepts. Augmented reality (AR) is a promising solution for the emerging design needs due to its diverse opportunities for user interaction and presenting information. This paper supports the development of novel AR applications. We describe a corresponding use case set consisting of 98 examples from a literature review and two focus groups. Based on these samples we present a design space for in-car AR applications. To demonstrate the benefit thereof, we show a fictional design process including our proposed design space to derive a custom AR system. This work supports designers and engineers by providing a systematic approach for integrating 3D AR interfaces in a vehicle, excluding windshields and windows.",

    "title": "Mapping Machine Learning Advances from HCI Research to Reveal Starting Places for Design Innovation",
    "abstract": "HCI has become particularly interested in using machine learning (ML) to improve user experience (UX). However, some design researchers claim that there is a lack of design innovation in envisioning how ML might improve UX. We investigate this claim by analyzing 2,494 related HCI research publications. Our review confirmed a lack of research integrating UX and ML. To help span this gap, we mined our corpus to generate a topic landscape, mapping out 7 clusters of ML technical capabilities within HCI. Among them, we identified 3 under-explored clusters that design researchers can dig in and create sensitizing concepts for. To help operationalize these technical design materials, our analysis then identified value channels through which the technical capabilities can provide value for users: self, context, optimal, and utility-capability. The clusters and the value channels collectively mark starting places for envisioning new ways for ML technology to improve people's lives.",

    "abstract": "Teens' financial literacy, their ability to understand financial concepts and make effective decisions, is an important topic in the US. Educational programs targeted at teens have had little impact. Our study investigated if parents should play a role in teaching their teens. We conducted a literature review on teenage financial literacy and a competitive analysis of current tools. We interviewed parents and teens, probing on what teens know and how they learned these concepts. We conducted speed dating sessions, exposing parents and teens to provocative services meant to trigger conversations about financial values. These included a system where parents gave loans and charged interest and a game where teens guessed the prices of family expenses. Results showed a strong interest for tools that allow parents to educate their teens. Concepts worked best when they addressed teens' current needs and when they allowed parents to influence spending based on values.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of HCI research carried out with nonprofit organizations has increased dramatically over the past 35 years. Despite this history and our accumulating understanding of social sector organizations and their diverse stakeholders’ use of technology, there have not yet been any systematic reviews of this body of research. Before making more holistic claims about what this body of knowledge might suggest for a research agenda moving forward, we carry out a systematic literature review to characterize the systemic biases that are present as a result of the varying degrees of inclusion or exclusion of the voices of different groups of stakeholders. Building off of the results of our analysis, we contribute a framework of Analytic Charismas for more broadly engaging in reflexivity as a discipline.",

    "title": "The design of eco-feedback technology",
    "abstract": "Eco-feedback technology provides feedback on individual or group behaviors with a goal of reducing environmental impact. The history of eco-feedback extends back more than 40 years to the origins of environmental psychology. Despite its stated purpose, few HCI eco-feedback studies have attempted to measure behavior change. This leads to two overarching questions: (1) what can HCI learn from environmental psychology and (2) what role should HCI have in designing and evaluating eco-feedback technology? To help answer these questions, this paper conducts a comparative survey of eco-feedback technology, including 89 papers from environmental psychology and 44 papers from the HCI and UbiComp literature. We also provide an overview of predominant models of proenvironmental behaviors and a summary of key motivation techniques to promote this behavior.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the mechanisms that shape the adoption and use of information technology is central to human--computer interaction. Two accounts are particularly vocal about these mechanisms, namely the technology acceptance model (TAM) and work on user experience (UX) models. In this study, we review 37 papers in the overlap between TAM and UX models to explore the experiential component of human--computer interactions. The models provide rich insights about what constructs influence the experiential component of human--computer interactions and about how these constructs are related. For example, the effect of perceived enjoyment on attitude is stronger than those of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. It is less clear why the relations exist and under which conditions the models apply. We discuss four of the main theories used in reasoning about the experiential component and, for example, point to the near absence of psychological needs and negative emotions in the models. In addition, most of the reviewed studies are not tied to specific use episodes, thereby bypassing tasks as an explanatory variable and undermining the accurate measurement of experiences, which are susceptible to moment-to-moment changes. We end by summarizing the implications of our review for future research.",

    "abstract": "Mindfulness is a term seen with increasing frequency in HCI literature, and yet the term itself is used almost as variously as the number of papers in which it appears. This diversity makes comparing or evaluating HCI approaches around mindfulness or understanding the design space itself a challenging task. We conducted a structured ACM literature search based on the term mindfulness. Our selection process yielded 38 relevant papers, which we analyzed for their definition, motivation, practice, evaluation and technology use around mindfulness. We identify similarities, divergences and areas of interest for each aspect, resulting in a framework composed of four perspectives and seven lines of research. We highlight challenges and opportunities for future HCI research and design.",
